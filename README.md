# Predictive-Analysis-for-Business-with-H20-in-R

In this project, we are going to focus on three objectives:

1 - Apply machine learning and predictive analytics to solve a business problem  
2 - Explain and describe automatic machine learning (AutoML)
3 - Perform Automatic Machine Learning with H2O and R  

By the end of this project, we will be able apply machine learning and predictive analytics to solve a business problem, explain and describe automatic machine learning, perform automatic machine learning (AutoML) with H2O in R. We will take a data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing. 

H2O is a leading open-source machine learning and artificial intelligence platform trusted by data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It has APIs available in R, Python, Scala, and also a web-based point and click interface called Flow. H2O's AutoML automates the process of training and tuning a large selection of models, allowing the user to focus on other aspects of the data science and machine learning pipelines such as data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model deployment.

The project on Predictive Analytics for Business with H2O in R is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Getting to Know the Marketing Data
Task 2: Load the Data into R
Task 3: Data Prep & Start H2O Cluster
Task 4: Run H2O AutoML
Task 5: AutoML Leaderboard and Ensemble Exploration
